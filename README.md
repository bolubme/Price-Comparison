<h1>Price Comparison Website</h1>

This project aims to simplify laptop shopping by providing a concise price comparison website. It scrapes data from Amazon, Ebuyer, Laptops Direct, Box, and StockMustGo, focusing on Apple, HP, and Lenovo laptops. Key features include:

Homepage: Highlights top laptops and deals, with a user-friendly search function.
Product Listings: Clear display of searched products.
Price Comparison: Real-time comparison of the same laptop across retailers.
Technologies Used:

Spring: For dependency injection and managing dependencies.
Maven: Facilitates dependency management.
Selenium: Web scraping from various retailers.
Hibernate: Efficient storage of scraped data in MySQL.
Node.js: Backend server for communication with MySQL through RESTful APIs.
Ajax: Integrates backend with frontend for data communication.
Vue.js: Implements most frontend functionalities for an interactive user interface.
Scraping involved asynchronous data retrieval from five websites, resulting in over 500 laptops. Data was structured and stored efficiently in a normalized MySQL database, categorizing laptop details, variations, and comparison data. Node.js facilitates seamless data retrieval from the backend to the frontend, powered by Vue.js.
